1. The purposes of the system calls are:
	- provides user the basic functionality to operate the operating system
	- provides the functionalities of loading, executing, and creating processes and terminating when the user's task is finished in the process
	- provide the functionalities of creating, deleting, opening, closing, and saving a file
	- provides functionalities of reading and writing a device
	- provides functionalities of creating and deleting communications, sending or receiving messages

2. Data structures associated with system calls:
	- functions

3. Files related to system calls in xv6:
	- sysproc.c
	- syscall.h
	- defs.h
	- user.h
	- syscall.c
	- usys.S
	- sysfunc.h
	
4. The way I will go with create a system call in xv6:
	1. add a line of code to reserve a system call number for my system call in syscall.h file
	
	2. open up the "syscall.c" file, and add a index for a pointer to my system call 
	at the end of the function pointer array in the "static int (*syscalls[])(void)" function
	
	3. then I will put the function prototype in the "syscall.c" file
	
	4. then I will implement this system call function in "sysproc.c" file
	
	5. open up the "usys.S" file and add SYSCALL(functionname) this line of code at the end
	
	6. open up "user.h" and add the system call function prototype at the end
